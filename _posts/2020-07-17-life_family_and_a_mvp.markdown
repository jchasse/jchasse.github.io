Why I decided to pursue software engineering?

When I think about motivations in my life, my mind immediately jumps to my family. I am a proud father of twin boys and soon to welcome a new addition to my family (next week!). Spending time with my wife and kids, to me, is the most satisfying and most amazing investments of time I could ever make. When large decisions are presented in my life, they are often a big percentage of consideration of the decision. 

I also have been extremely fortunate in my life. Fortunate to have great supporting parents, an amazing loving wife, and decent health. Throughout my life, I have played a sort of game when it came to big decisions and trying to navigate the craziness of life. I like to fast forward my life 20, 30, or 40 years and think about when I am at that age in my life, what do I hope to have accomplished. Then, I take that feeling, lifestyle, and those relationships and pretend to look back on that decision. 

Questions I ask myself:
 - Will this decision get me going in that direction?
 - Will I have the opportunity to generate relationships and a sense of community?
 - Will this support the pillars of what I am hoping to accomplish?
 - Will this be an experience I can cherish throughout my life?
 - Will this allow me and my family continued opportunities?


After reflecting on those and similar questions, it tends to remove a lot of the "noise" of life and focus on what matters most to make the best decision.

Here is what I hope to accomplish in my life....with the wisdom of a 34 year old:
 - Family & Friends - the people that I love the most, love me back
 - Sustainability - leaving this world better than when I found it
 - Financial Literacy - teaching others financial awareness and education
 - Lifelong learner - continuing to challenge my way of thinking and awareness of the world
 
 How does that intersect with coding?
 Roll my personality overlays now......I am extremely entrepreneurial, quasi-self aware idealist, extremely curious, challenge and financially motivated.
 
 Immediately prior to engaging with Flatiron, I had the opportunity to be laid off from an extremely high flying unicorn that hit a rough patch. My entrepreneurial spirit immediately kicked in.....with large aspirations of creating a company. Being a homeowner, enthusiast of technology and efficiency, and idealist that thoroughly enjoys ideating, I was quick to whip up a plethora of ideas to launch ranging from a sod (grass) operations company (ie, creating an automated supply chain and work flow command center to sell the technology to farmers, wholesalers, and retailers streamlining the whole industry // real life frustrating issue..ask me about it sometime) to an automated residential property tax protesting software. Many many ideas with real life challenges people are spending real $s on today.
 
 The opportunities I see are abundant, but at the time, jumping into low code or no code app design websites still did not yield the goal I was seeking...to get an MVP (minimum viable product) created quickly, cost effectively, and efficiently to test whether these ideas had any legs.
 
So my goals for this course are tri-fold:
 - to pursue my lifelong goals of continued learning and to develop tools a baseline that may drive non-profit impacts in financial literacy and sustainability 
 - to gain enough skills to couple with amazing low code/no code development sites to immediately launch an MVP
 - to re-establish a baseline back in a technical field for continuing a career in leadership

MVPs and businesses don't always work out and I would love to build my skill set deeper in coding to make a charge in program/product management and tech leadership. With my formal BS in engineering coupled with years of finance, operations, and leadership experience, I know I would love to continue to create a life, not just a living through intrapreneurship or entrepreneurship.

Cheers!
